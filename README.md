# Physics-informed neural network-based computational solid mechanics
This repository provides numerical examples of physics-informed neural network-based computational solid mechanics framework. 

Physics-informed neural network (PINN) has recently gained increasing interest in computational  mechanics.

This work aims to help the researchers who are interested in the PINN-based solid mechanics solver to have a clear insight into this emerging area.

Numerical examples include:
 - 1D stretching plate problem (implemented by collocation and energy-based loss functions)
 - 2D in-plain stretching plate problem (implemented by collocation loss function)
 - 2D in-plain stretching plate problem (implemented by energy-based loss function)
 - 3D streching cube problem (implemented by collocation loss function)

Information regarding the numerical examples, please refer to our paper.
